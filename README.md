Weekly workbooks for Just IT Data Analysis Bootcamp
I used these workbooks to solidify my education on different Data Analysis best practices, methodologies, and techniques. 

Over the weeks, I was able to hone my ETL and database management skills, by cleaning data in excel, grouping, merging and joining different datasheets in MYSQL and python, as well as really hone my analytical thinking and visual storytelling abilities.
